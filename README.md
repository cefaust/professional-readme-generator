# Professional readme generator

## Description
I am creating this project to allow users to have a template to create a professional readme. By using this app the user will be able to provide info, and then it will be injected into a readme template.

###  Things included in this Readme generator

1. Users will use a command-line application that when prompted the user will answer a series of questions that will create a high quality, professional Readme.md.
2. The readme will include Title of project, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
3. Users will be prompted the title of the project and the answer will be injected into that section.
4. Users will also be asked for a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions that will be added to those specific sections.
5. Users will select a specific license from a list that will be included in that section.
6. Users will add a GitHub link to the question's section that will allow others to contact them with questions.
7. Users will be able to click on the Table of contents and jump to that section.
